# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

When you initialise, you should sync: 
  1. requirements.md in the project root folder with the Kenny V4 Notion page at https://www.notion.so/2614c2f4d2f2811c92dbc7b14255eae8 and 
  2. roadmap.md with the Kanban Board at URL: https://www.notion.so/2634c2f4d2f280c5a683e6f514f14dca via the Notion MCP Connector

The Kenny V4 Notion page contains detailed architecture, implementation phases, and technical specifications for building a personal AI assistant that can access native MacOS apps (Mail, Calendar, Messages, WhatsApp, etc.).

The Kenny Kanban database is embedded within the main Kenny V4 project page as a subpage for tracking development progress across the different phases and features. It has status tracking: Not started → In development → Testing → Reviewing → Done. Properties: Name, Status, Epic, Team, Assign, Deadline, AI keywords. It is the source of truth for all tasks associated with the Kenny project.

## Development Commands

No build system has been established yet. Common commands will be documented here once the project technology stack is determined.

## Architecture

Project architecture will be documented here as the codebase grows.
